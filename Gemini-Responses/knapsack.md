Certainly, let's correct the provided Java code for the Knapsack problem.

```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.*;

public class Knapsack {
    public static int knapsack(int capacity, int[][] items) {
        int n = items.length;
        int[][] memo = new int[n + 1][capacity + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { 
            for (int j = 0; j <= capacity; j++) {
                int weight = items[i - 1][0]; 
                int value = items[i - 1][1];

                if (j < weight) { 
                    memo[i][j] = memo[i - 1][j]; 
                } else {
                    memo[i][j] = Math.max(memo[i - 1][j], value + memo[i - 1][j - weight]); 
                }
            }
        }

        return memo[n][capacity];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] items = {{2, 10}, {3, 14}, {4, 16}, {5, 30}}; 
        int capacity = 7;

        int maxValue = knapsack(capacity, items);
        System.out.println("Maximum value: " + maxValue); 
    }
}
```

Here are the corrections made:

1. **Initialization of `i` loop:** The outer loop iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive) to correctly handle the base case and avoid out-of-bounds array access.
2. **Weight and Value assignment:** The `weight` and `value` variables are assigned within the inner loop to ensure they are correctly associated with the current item being considered.
3. **Base case handling:** The base cases (`i == 0` or `j == 0`) are implicitly handled by the initialization of the `memo` array with zeros.
4. **Condition for weight check:** The condition for checking if the current weight exceeds the remaining capacity is corrected to `j < weight`.
5. **Added `main` method:** A `main` method is added to demonstrate how to use the `knapsack` function with sample input.

This corrected code should now correctly solve the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming with memoization.

I hope this helps!
