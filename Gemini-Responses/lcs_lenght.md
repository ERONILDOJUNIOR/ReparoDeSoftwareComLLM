Certainly, let's correct the provided Java code for finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) length.

Here's the corrected code with explanations:

```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.*;

public class LCS_LENGTH {
    public static int lcs_length(String s, String t) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length() + 1][t.length() + 1]; 

        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= t.length(); j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 0; // Base case: empty string
                } else if (s.charAt(i - 1) == t.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1; // If characters match, increase LCS length
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]); // Choose the maximum from previous row or column
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[s.length()][t.length()]; 
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "ABCDGH";
        String t = "AEDFHR";
        int lcsLength = lcs_length(s, t);
        System.out.println("LCS Length: " + lcsLength); // Output: LCS Length: 3
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Used a 2D Array:** Instead of a nested HashMap, a 2D array (`dp`) is used for efficient storage and retrieval of intermediate results. This significantly improves both space and time complexity.

2. **Simplified Logic:** The code is streamlined with clear and concise logic for handling base cases and character matching.

3. **Removed Unnecessary Checks:** The code avoids unnecessary checks like `dp.containsKey(i-1)` and `!dp.isEmpty()`, making it more efficient.

4. **Improved Readability:** The code is formatted with proper indentation and meaningful variable names for better readability and maintainability.

5. **Added a Main Method:** A `main` method is included to demonstrate how to use the `lcs_length` function with example strings.

This corrected code provides a more efficient and readable solution for finding the LCS length between two strings.
