# BitCount

Certainly, let's correct the Java code for counting the number of set bits in an integer.

Corrected Code:

```java
package java_programs;

/**

* This class provides a method to count the number of set bits
* (bits with value 1) in an integer.
*
* @author derricklin (Original author)
 */
public class BITCOUNT {

    public static int bitcount(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            n &= (n - 1); // Corrected line
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 15; // Example integer
        int setBits = bitcount(num);
        System.out.println("Number of set bits in " + num + ": " + setBits);
    }
}
```

Explanation of the Correction:

The original code n = (n ^ (n - 1)); was incorrect.

The XOR operation (^) flips the rightmost set bit to 0.
However, it also flips other bits, which is not intended for counting set bits.
The corrected line n &= (n - 1); uses the bitwise AND operator (&)

n - 1 creates a number where the rightmost set bit of n and all the bits to its right are flipped.
n & (n - 1) clears the rightmost set bit in n.
The corrected code efficiently counts the number of set bits by repeatedly clearing the rightmost set bit until the number becomes zero.

Key Points:

This method is known as Brian Kernighan's Algorithm for counting set bits.
It is considered an efficient method for counting set bits in integers.
I hope this corrected code is helpful!
