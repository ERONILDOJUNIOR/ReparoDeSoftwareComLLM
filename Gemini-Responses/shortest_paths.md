Certainly, let's correct the provided Java code for finding the shortest paths in a graph.

```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.*;

public class ShortestPaths {
    final static int INF = 99999;

    public static Map<String, Integer> shortest_paths(String source, Map<List<String>, Integer> weight_by_edge) {
        Map<String, Integer> dist = new HashMap<>(); 
        for (List<String> edge : weight_by_edge.keySet()) {
            dist.put(edge.get(0), INF);
            dist.put(edge.get(1), INF);
        }
        dist.put(source, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < weight_by_edge.size(); i++) { 
            for (List<String> edge : weight_by_edge.keySet()) {
                int u = edge.get(0);
                int v = edge.get(1);
                int w = weight_by_edge.get(edge); 

                if (dist.get(u) != INF && dist.get(u) + w < dist.get(v)) {
                    dist.put(v, dist.get(u) + w);
                }
            }
        }
        return dist;
    }

    public static Map<String, Integer> shortest_paths(Node source, List<WeightedEdge> weight_by_edge) {
        Map<String, Integer> dist = new HashMap<>();
        for (WeightedEdge edge : weight_by_edge) {
            dist.put(edge.node1.toString(), INF);
            dist.put(edge.node2.toString(), INF);
        }
        dist.put(source.getValue(), 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < weight_by_edge.size(); i++) {
            for (WeightedEdge edge : weight_by_edge) {
                int u = Integer.parseInt(edge.node1.toString()); 
                int v = Integer.parseInt(edge.node2.toString());
                int w = edge.weight;

                if (dist.get(u + "") != INF && dist.get(u + "") + w < dist.get(v + "")) { 
                    dist.put(v + "", dist.get(u + "") + w);
                }
            }
        }
        return dist;
    }
}

```

**Key Corrections:**

1. **Incorrect Weight Updates:**
   - The original code incorrectly updated the `weight_by_edge` map within the inner loop. The shortest path distances should be stored in a separate `dist` map.
   - The inner loop logic was flawed. It should check if relaxing an edge can lead to a shorter path and update the `dist` map accordingly.

2. **Unnecessary `Math.min`:**
   - The `Math.min` call was unnecessary and incorrect. The code should directly compare the current distance to the potential shorter path through the edge.

3. **Node Handling:**
   - In the second version, the code assumes that `Node` values are integers. If this is not the case, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.

4. **Clarity and Readability:**
   - Added more descriptive variable names (e.g., `u`, `v`, `w`) to improve code readability.

**Explanation:**

- The corrected code maintains a `dist` map to store the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes.
- It iterates through the edges repeatedly, relaxing each edge in turn.
- Relaxation checks if the distance to a node can be shortened by going through a neighboring node.
- The algorithm continues until no further improvements can be made.

**Note:**

- This corrected code implements a basic version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
- For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a more efficient algorithm like topological sort can be used.

I hope this corrected version is helpful!
