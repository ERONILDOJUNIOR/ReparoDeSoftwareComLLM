Certainly, let's correct the Java code for finding the square root of a number using the Newton-Raphson method.

```java
package java_programs;

public class SQRT {
    public static double sqrt(double x, double epsilon) {
        if (x < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number.");
        }

        if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        double approx = x / 2d; 
        while (Math.abs(x - approx * approx) > epsilon) { 
            approx = 0.5d * (approx + x / approx);
        }
        return approx;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double number = 25; 
        double epsilon = 0.00001; 

        double result = sqrt(number, epsilon);
        System.out.println("Square root of " + number + " is approximately: " + result); 
    }
}
```

Here's what has been corrected:

1. **Negative Number Handling:**
   - The code now includes a check for negative input values. If the input `x` is negative, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` as the square root of a negative number is not a real number.

2. **Zero Handling:**
   - A special case is added to handle the input `x` being zero. In this case, the square root is simply zero, and the function returns 0 directly.

3. **Convergence Condition:**
   - The `while` loop condition has been corrected. Instead of checking `Math.abs(x - approx)`, it should check `Math.abs(x - approx * approx)`. This ensures that the algorithm converges to the actual square root of the number.

4. **Main Method:**
   - A `main` method has been added to demonstrate how to use the `sqrt` function.
   - It sets the `number` to 25 and `epsilon` to 0.00001.
   - It calls the `sqrt` function and prints the calculated square root.

This corrected code provides a more robust and accurate implementation of the square root function using the Newton-Raphson method.
