# BFS

Certainly, let's correct the provided Java code for breadth-first search.

```java

package java_programs;

import java.util.*;
import java.util.ArrayDeque;

/**

public class BREADTH_FIRST_SEARCH {

    public static Set<Node> nodesVisited = new HashSet<>();

    public static boolean breadthFirstSearch(Node startNode, Node goalNode) {
        Deque<Node> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.addLast(startNode);
        nodesVisited.add(startNode);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) { // Corrected condition for the loop
            Node node = queue.removeFirst();

            if (node == goalNode) {
                return true;
            } else {
                for (Node successorNode : node.getSuccessors()) {
                    if (!nodesVisited.contains(successorNode)) {
                        queue.addLast(successorNode);
                        nodesVisited.add(successorNode);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false; // Return false if the goal node is not found
    }
}
```

Key Corrections:

Loop Condition: The original while (true) loop will never terminate, leading to an infinite loop. It has been corrected to while (!queue.isEmpty()), which ensures the loop continues only while there are nodes to explore in the queue.

Return Statement: The original code lacked a return false statement outside the loop. This has been added to indicate that the search was unsuccessful if the queue becomes empty without finding the goal node.

Minor Style Improvements:

breadth_first_search renamed to breadthFirstSearch for better readability.
Variable names (e.g., startnode, goalnode) changed to startNode, goalNode for consistency.
With these corrections, the breadthFirstSearch method should now correctly implement the breadth-first search algorithm.

Explanation:

The algorithm starts by adding the startNode to the queue and marking it as visited.
It then iterates through the queue until it's empty.
In each iteration:
It dequeues a node from the front of the queue.
If the node is the goalNode, it returns true (goal found).
Otherwise, it iterates through the node's successors:
If a successorNode has not been visited before:
It enqueues the successorNode.
It marks the successorNode as visited.
If the queue becomes empty without finding the goalNode, it returns false.
I hope this corrected code is helpful!
