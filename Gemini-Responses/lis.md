Certainly, let's correct the provided Java code for finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

**Corrected Code:**

```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.*;

public class LIS {

    public static int lis(int[] arr) {
        int[] ends = new int[arr.length + 1]; 
        Arrays.fill(ends, Integer.MAX_VALUE); 
        ends[0] = Integer.MIN_VALUE; 
        int len = 0; 

        for (int x : arr) {
            int i = Arrays.binarySearch(ends, 0, len + 1, x);
            if (i < 0) {
                i = -(i + 1);
            }
            ends[i] = x;
            if (i == len) {
                len++;
            }
        }

        return len;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60};
        System.out.println("Length of LIS is " + lis(arr)); 
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Optimized Data Structure:**
   - Replaced the `HashMap<Integer, Integer> ends` with an array `int[] ends`. This improves space efficiency and simplifies the logic.
   - `ends[i]` now stores the minimum value that can end an LIS of length `i`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Instead of iterating through all previous lengths, we use binary search to efficiently find the appropriate position for the current element in the `ends` array. This significantly reduces the time complexity.

3. **Simplified Logic:**
   - The logic is streamlined to be more concise and easier to understand.

4. **Added Main Method:**
   - Included a `main` method to demonstrate how to use the `lis` function with an example array.

**Key Improvements:**

- **Time Complexity:** Reduced from O(n^2) to O(n log n) due to the use of binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** Improved by using an array instead of a HashMap.
- **Readability:** Enhanced code clarity and maintainability.

This corrected code provides a more efficient and elegant solution for finding the Longest Increasing Subsequence in an array.
