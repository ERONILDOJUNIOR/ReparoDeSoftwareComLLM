Certainly, let's correct the provided Java code for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):

```java
package java_programs;

import java.util.Scanner; 

public class GCD {

    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        } else {
            return gcd(b, a % b); 
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();

        int result = gcd(num1, num2);

        System.out.println("The GCD of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is: " + result);

        scanner.close(); 
    }
}
```

Here are the corrections made:

1. **Corrected GCD Calculation:**
   - The `gcd` function has been modified to correctly implement Euclid's algorithm.
   - In each recursive call, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. This ensures that the smaller number is always passed as the second argument, which is crucial for the algorithm's efficiency.

2. **Added `main` Method:**
   - A `main` method has been added to allow the code to be executed as a standalone program.
   - The `main` method:
     - Creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the user.
     - Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
     - Calls the `gcd` function to calculate the GCD.
     - Prints the result to the console.
     - Closes the `Scanner` to release resources.

3. **Import `Scanner`:**
   - The `import java.util.Scanner;` statement has been added to import the `Scanner` class, which is used for user input.

This corrected code should now accurately calculate and display the GCD of two given integers.
